async def create_plan_for_problem(problem_id: int):
    plan = generate_plan(problem_id)
    return plan
```

### **AI Agent System**
```python
# Intelligent workflow orchestration
class LifeHackAgent:
    def solve_problem(self, problem_id: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        plan = generate_plan(problem_id)
        tasks = self._create_tasks_from_plan(plan)
        automation_suggestions = self._suggest_automations(plan)
        return complete_solution
```
